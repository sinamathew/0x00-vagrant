# Vagrant & Ubuntu

Vagrant is a tool for building and managing virtual machine environments in a single workflow. With an easy-to-use workflow and focus on automation, Vagrant lowers development environment setup time, increases production parity, and makes the *"works on my machine"* excuse a relic of the past.

## History of Vagrant

Vagrant was first started as a personal side-project by Mitchell Hashimoto in January 2010. The first version of Vagrant was released in March 2010.

## Ubuntu Linux

Ubuntu is a Debian-based distribution, often considered the best distribution if you are new to the Linux system. Ubuntu has widespread use in personal and desktop systems but is also used in servers across the internet.

The feature that stands out in Ubuntu is its use of GNOME (GNU Network Object Model Environment), a graphical user interface and set of applications that are similar to the Windows operating system.

Ubuntu is maintained by Canonical, a community of developers that roll out new versions every six months and then roll out long-term support every two years.

By default, Ubuntu contains a whole host of applications including LibreOffice, Firefox, Thunderbird, and Transmission, along with some simple games.

Additional applications can be installed using the APT package management system or “Ubuntu Software,” which is the default app store that comes with Ubuntu.
